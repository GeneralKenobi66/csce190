      <h2>Problem statement: Crowded Public Spaces</h2>

        <p>
          We sorted our diagram by Profitability, Solutions, user feedback, requirements, and hurdles. We seperated it into these groups so we could break our brainstorming into seperate sections.

      <p>
        The persona I created was named Grandma Betty, she is a 90 year old grandma who is not very technology literate. She enjoys going to the pond to feed the ducks but it is always so 
        busy when she goes. A product that would let her know how busy the park is at a given time would benifiet her as she would know when and when not to go.

            <p>
              This storyboard follows the path of a Grandma using an app to confirm if a park is not busy before she leaves to go feed the ducks.

                  <p>
                    For my sketch I created a menu where the user could select a place on campus to see how buys it if. If the user decides to go they are asked by the app how accurate its rating is so it can change to be more accurate.
