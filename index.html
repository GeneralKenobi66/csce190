      <h2>Problem statement: Crowded Public Spaces</h2>
        <p>
          University students do not know if a public space is crowded before they arrive there.

        <p>
          We sorted our diagram by Profitability, Solutions, user feedback, requirements, and hurdles. We seperated it into these groups so we could break our brainstorming into seperate sections.

      <p>
        The persona I created was named Grandma Betty, she is a 90 year old grandma who is not very technology literate. She enjoys going to the pond to feed the ducks but it is always so 
        busy when she goes. A product that would let her know how busy the park is at a given time would benifiet her as she would know when and when not to go.

            <p>
              This storyboard follows the path of a Grandma using an app to confirm if a park is not busy before she leaves to go feed the ducks.
